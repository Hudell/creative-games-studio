# Creative Studio

Creative Studio is a free tool for game development. It is powerful enough to run different styles of games but it's simple enough to be used by anybody. You can create a good game with it even if you don't know any programming language, but if you do, you're free to use it too!

The engine is being development since the first week of 2016 and has been advancing at a good pace.
